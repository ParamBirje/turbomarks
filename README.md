# Turbomarks

_A better way to access commonly accessed bookmarks/links._

## Motivation

After switching to neovim, I realized navigating in the browser could also be done by vim motions. So I got [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium). But it had one problem, the bookmark feature doesn't function on the chrome's default new tab. Now that I love the customization of keybinds to various commands I can have in neovim, I thought why not have something like that for the links that I access often. Additionally, I'd get experience building my first extension!

Now I can just choose a shorthand (eg. `ats`) for the url I want to access (eg. https://github.com/ParamBirje/auto-sslx) and whenever I feel like accessing that link -
- I press (`t` or `ctrl+t`) to open a new tab
- Type my shorthand and enter!

## Usage

### Accessing

- Press the key `;` in the searchbar and press space to activate Turbomarks.
- Now enter the shorthand you had set for a URL you want to access.

### Creating

- To add a new turbomark, click the extension icon in the extensions toolbar/area.
- Choose a shorthand
- Enter the URL you want to map the shorthand to

### Updating

- For now there's no update button on each item, but you can use the same form fields to update the shorthand URL
- Just enter the same shorthand (that you want to update the URL for)
- Assign the new URL and click `STORE`
